## Getting started

Depending on the platform setup, the asset may initialize automatically or may need to be manually executed. To manually execute the asset, run the command `./gcp-anthos-policy.sh` on the terminal.

When you run the script, it sets up the pre-requisite automation tools behind the scenes. 

Please be patient, and allow a few seconds for the lab to initialize. 

You will be prompted to enter any key to continue once the initialization process is complete.

If the step by step guide is not displayed automatically, enter `G` below the `What additional steps do you want to perform...` prompt.

There are 3 modes of operation. 

Set the mode of operation by selecting option `0` on the menu, and enter your preference from the list below:

- `y` to preview configuration or commands.
- `n` to execute commands in the create mode.
- `d` to delete resources in the delete mode.

Click the **START** button below to continue to the next page.

## Selecting a project

You need to select a project for this lab.

*Hint: You should be the Owner or Editor of this project. We recommend deleting the project at the end of the lab or using the `d` option to delete provisioned resources and avoid incurring additional costs.*

Set the create mode by selecting `0` at the menu, and enter `n` at the prompt.

Click the **NEXT** button to continue.
