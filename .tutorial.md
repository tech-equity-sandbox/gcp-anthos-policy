## Getting started

Depending on the platform setup, the asset may initialize automatically or may need to be manually executed. 

To manually execute the asset, run the bash script ending with `.sh` on the terminal, e.g.  `./gcp-anthos-policy.sh`.

When you run the script, it sets up the pre-requisite automation tools behind the scenes. 

Please be patient, and allow a few seconds for the lab to initialize. 

You will be prompted to enter any key to continue once the initialization process is complete.

If the step by step guide is not displayed automatically on the right hand side, enter `G` below the `What additional steps do you want to perform...` prompt.

Click the **START** button below to continue to the next page.

## Previewing Commands 

The preview mode is the default mode of operation. 

To simplify the experience, the preview mode displays only the CLI commands from the cloud provider SDK.

Enter any key at the `$` prompt to return to the menu, and click the **NEXT** button to continue.

## Creating Resources

To create resources, you must switch to the create mode, authenticate and specify a Google Cloud project. 

To switch to the preview mode, enter `0` in the menu and `n` at the prompt.

If prompted to enter a valid code, enter the code to proceed. 

If prompted to authenticate to `gcloud`, click the link displayed, sign-in using your Google Cloud account, and click the `Allow` button to grant permissions to Google Cloud SDK. 

Click the `Copy` button to copy the authorization code. 

Return to the cloud shell terminal and paste the authorization code into the prompt to authenticate.

Enter a valid Google Cloud project ID at the prompt to confirm the project you intend to use. 

*Hint: You should be the Owner or Editor of this project.*

Enter any key at the `$` prompt to return to the menu, and click the **NEXT** button to continue.

## Deleting Resources

We recommend deleting resources at the end of the lab to avoid incurring additional costs.

To delete resources, you must switch to the delete mode, and you must authenticate to gcloud. 

To switch to the delete mode, enter `0` in the menu and `d` at the prompt.

If prompted to enter a valid code, enter the code to proceed. 

If prompted to authenticate to `gcloud`, click the link displayed, sign-in using your Google Cloud account, and click the `Allow` button to grant permissions to Google Cloud SDK. 

Click the `Copy` button to copy the authorization code. 

Return to the cloud shell terminal and paste the authorization code into the prompt to authenticate to cloud shell.

Enter a valid Google Cloud project ID at the prompt to confirm the project you intend to use. 

Enter the number for the step corresponding to the resouces you wish to delete.

Enter any key at the `$` prompt to return to the menu, and click the **NEXT** button to continue.

## Customizations

To change environment configuration such as regions and zones, edit the hidden `.env` file in the  directory where the script is located.

To switch to a new project after authentication, delete the project service account from the folder where the script is located. The service account is saved as a hidden file in format `.$PROJECT_ID.json`

**Estimated Time to complete**: 45 minutes
