Follow the steps below to get started.

**Step 1**

Type `ls` to view the script. 

Type a command similar to `./gcp-anthos-azure.sh` to run the script, where gcp-anthos-azure.sh is the script name in this scenario.

**Step 2**

Enter options from the menu to preview the commands.

**Step 3**

To execute the commands, enter option M and follow the instructions to login and specify a Google Cloud project. We recommend using a different project for each lab. 

**Don't forget to clean up after yourself.** Delete the project to avoid charges.
